## youtube-digital-library

MSU Library has created a digital video library using the Youtube API to power our local library channel. It is a complete search and browse app with item level views, microdata, a caching and optimization routine, and a file backup routine. The article will discuss applying the YouTube API as a database application layer, workflow efficiencies gained, metadata procedures as well as local backup and optimization procedures. Code samples in PHP, .htaccess examples, and shell commands used in developing the app and routines will be explained at length. And finally, a complete prototype app will be released on github for other libraries to get started using the lessons learned. A live version of the app is here: http://www.lib.montana.edu/channel/. The real benefit of this method is the low overhead for smaller shops and the ability to scale production and distribution of digital video.
